## How to improve GitHub Copilot Chat responses

**Scope referencing**
To enhance the accuracy and relevance of the responses provided by GitHub Copilot Chat, it’s important to properly scope your questions using references. Here’s how you can do that:

**File references**: You can specify a particular file in your question by adding a #file: before the file name.

For example, if you’re working with a file named controller.js, you can use the #file command to select it and reference it directly in your question as #file:controller.js. This tells Copilot Chat to focus on the contents of that file when generating a response.

**Environment References**: You can reference the entire solution or workspace by using @workspace. This allows Copilot Chat to consider the broader context of the projects and configurations that are currently open in your Visual Studio IDE. For instance, asking "@workspace where is the calculate function?" will prompt Copilot to consider the entire solution to find the most relevant information.

## Slash commands
Slash commands in GitHub Copilot Chat allow you to quickly specify the intent of your query. This can significantly improve the quality of the responses you receive by making your requests more focused. Here are some commonly used slash commands:

**/doc**: Adds comments to the specified or selected code. For example, you can type /doc followed by the code you want to document, and Copilot will generate appropriate comments.

**/explain**: Provides explanations for selected code. This is particularly useful when you need to understand what a particular piece of code does. For example, /explain the #file:controller.js will give you a detailed explanation of that file.

**/fix**: Proposes fixes for problems in the selected code. If you're facing issues, you can highlight the problematic section and use /fix to receive suggestions for resolving the issue.

**/generate**: Helps in generating new code based on your requirements. For example, /generate code to find the root of a number in client.js will create a function to perform the task.

**/optimize**: Analyzes and suggests improvements to the running time or efficiency of the selected code. For instance, /optimize the calculate method in controller.js will focus on enhancing the performance of that specific method.

![optimize](https://github.com/codess-aus/GitHub-Copilot-Certification/blob/86883992639778e328a95c9302bfeff1548a14db/images/optimize.png)

**/tests**: Automatically creates unit tests for the selected code. You can simply highlight the code and use /tests using Mocha to generate tests.

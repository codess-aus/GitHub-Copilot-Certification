# Identify limitations of GitHub Copilot

## Code quality and correctness
- **Potential for errors**: GitHub Copilot can sometimes suggest code that contains bugs or doesn't fully meet requirements.
- **Security concerns**: Generated code may not always adhere to best security practices, requiring careful review.
- **Context misinterpretation**: GitHub Copilot might misunderstand the broader context, leading to inappropriate suggestions.

## Language and framework specificity
- **Varying performance**: GitHub Copilot's effectiveness can vary across different programming languages and frameworks.
- **Niche technologies**: For less common or newer technologies, suggestions may be less accurate or relevant.

## Dependency on training data
- **Bias in suggestions**: GitHub Copilot's suggestions reflect patterns in its training data, which may include biases or outdated practices.
- **Copyright concerns**: There's ongoing debate about the copyright implications of code generated from trained models.

## Complex problem solving
- **Limitation in high-level design**: GitHub Copilot excels at code-level tasks but may not grasp complex architectural decisions*.
- **Creativity constraints**: While helpful, GitHub Copilot cannot replace human creativity in solving novel problems.

* One of the reasons you cannot replace your developers with GitHub Copilot is because it is not an architect. It cares only about the code not so much about the design. It will adhere to a design it see's but it's planning might not be as good as your own architects and senior devs could do.

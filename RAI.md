# Responsible AI

Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents numerous opportunities for innovation and efficiency, but it also comes with significant risks that need to be carefully managed.

One of the primary concerns is that AI systems can sometimes make decisions that are difficult to interpret, leading to a lack of transparency and accountability. Additionally, AI can result in unintended and harmful outcomes, such as biased decision-making or privacy violations.

To mitigate these risks, it is essential to implement robust governance frameworks, ensure transparency in AI processes, and incorporate human oversight. By doing so, organizations can harness the benefits of AI while minimizing potential negative impacts.

## 6 key principles:

- **Fairness**: AI systems should treat all people fairly.
- **Reliability and safety**: AI systems should perform reliably and safely.
- **Privacy and security**: AI systems should be secure and respect privacy.
- **Inclusiveness**: AI systems should empower everyone and engage people.
- **Transparency**: AI systems should be understandable.
- **Accountability**: People should be accountable for AI systems.

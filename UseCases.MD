# Developer use cases for AI with GitHub Copilot

## Accelerate learning new programming languages and frameworks

Learning new programming languages or frameworks can be challenging, but GitHub Copilot makes this process smoother and faster, enabling developers to quickly grasp new concepts and apply them in practice. GitHub Copilot helps bridge the gap between learning and actual implementation through:

- **Code suggestions**: Offers context-aware code snippets suggestions that illustrate the usage of unfamiliar functions and libraries, guiding developers on proper usage and implementation when working with new frameworks.
- **Language support**: Supports a wide range of languages, helping you transition smoothly from one language to another.
- **Documentation integration**: By providing inline suggestions related to API usage and function parameters, GitHub Copilot reduces the need to constantly refer to external documentation.

## Minimizing context switching

Context switching is a significant productivity drain for developers and can disrupt your workflow and reduce focus. GitHub Copilot helps maintain focus by providing relevant code suggestions within your current context, allowing you to concentrate on solving complex problems. The following are ways GitHub Copilot help to achieve this:

- **In-editor assistance**: GitHub Copilot provides code suggestions directly in the IDE, minimizing the need to search for solutions online.
- **Quick references**: When working with APIs or libraries, GitHub Copilot can suggest correct method calls and parameters, reducing the need to consult documentation.
- **Code completion**: By autocompleting repetitive code patterns, GitHub Copilot allows developers to maintain their train of thought without interruption.

## Enhanced documentation writing
GitHub Copilot significantly improves the process of writing and maintaining code documentation:

- **Inline comments**: Generates contextually relevant inline comments explaining complex code sections.
- **Function descriptions**: Automatically suggests function descriptions, including parameter explanations and return value details.
- **README generation**: Assists in creating project README files by suggesting structure and content based on the project's codebase.
- **Documentation consistency**: Helps maintain consistent documentation style across a project.

GitHub Copilot can assimilate your code, and help you write relevant comments or documentation for functions or the entire code.

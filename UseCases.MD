# Developer use cases for AI with GitHub Copilot

## Accelerate learning new programming languages and frameworks

Learning new programming languages or frameworks can be challenging, but GitHub Copilot makes this process smoother and faster, enabling developers to quickly grasp new concepts and apply them in practice. GitHub Copilot helps bridge the gap between learning and actual implementation through:

- **Code suggestions**: Offers context-aware code snippets suggestions that illustrate the usage of unfamiliar functions and libraries, guiding developers on proper usage and implementation when working with new frameworks.
- **Language support**: Supports a wide range of languages, helping you transition smoothly from one language to another.
- **Documentation integration**: By providing inline suggestions related to API usage and function parameters, GitHub Copilot reduces the need to constantly refer to external documentation.

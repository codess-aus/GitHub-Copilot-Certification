## Types of comments utilized
Copilot can work with various types of comments to inform its suggestions:

- Inline comments: Short explanations next to specific lines of code.
- Block comments: Longer explanations that might describe a function or class.
- Docstrings: Formal documentation strings in languages like Python.
- TODO comments: Notes about future implementations or improvements.
- API Documentation: Comments that describe the usage and parameters of functions or methods.

## Comment-driven code generation
Copilot uses comments in several ways to generate and suggest code:
**Function implementation**: When a function is described in comments, Copilot can suggest an entire implementation based on that description.

**Code completion**: Copilot uses comments to provide more accurate code completions, understanding the developer's intent.

In this example, we have a comment describing a function to reverse a string. Based on this comment, Copilot is likely to suggest an implementation using Python's slice notation with a step of -1, which efficiently reverses the string.

**Variable naming**: Comments can influence Copilot's suggestions for variable names, making them more descriptive and context-appropriate.

Here, we have a comment describing a list of the user's favorite books. Copilot would likely suggest descriptive variable names that match the context. In this case, it suggested "favorite_books" as the variable name, which clearly describes the content of the list.

**Algorithm selection**: When comments describe a specific algorithm or approach, Copilot can suggest code that aligns with that method.

# Contractual Protections

- **IP indemnity**: The GitHub Copilot Business and Enterprise plans include IP indemnity, which provides legal protection against intellectual property claims related to the use of Copilot suggestions. With IP indemnity, if any suggestion from GitHub Copilot is challenged as infringing on third-party IP rights, GitHub assumes legal responsibility. For GitHub to assume legal responsibility, the Matching public code setting must be blocked.
- **Data Protection Agreement (DPA)**: GitHub offers a DPA that outlines the measures taken to protect your data and ensure compliance with data privacy regulations. These agreements provide transparency and assurance that your data is handled securely and responsibly.
- **GitHub Copilot Trust Center**: The GitHub Copilot Trust Center provides detailed information about how GitHub Copilot works, including security, privacy, compliance, and intellectual property safeguards. This resource helps organizations feel confident using GitHub Copilot while adhering to best practices and legal requirements.

## Filtering out matching public code
GitHub Copilot can help minimize potential code overlap by identifying and filtering out code suggestions that match publicly available code. This feature is essential for maintaining the originality and security of your codebase. It can reduce the risk of incorporating nonsecure or noncompliant code into your projects.

## Manage content exclusions
The content exclusion feature in GitHub Copilot helps protect sensitive information by preventing the use of specific files, directories, or repositories to inform code-completion suggestions.

- Enabling content exclusions from repositories and organizations.
- Analyzing the impact of content exclusions on generated code suggestions.
- Identifying scenarios where content exclusions might not be fully effective.

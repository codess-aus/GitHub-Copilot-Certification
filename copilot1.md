# Code completion with GitHub Copilot

## Auto suggestions
Copilot offers code suggestions as you type: sometimes completing the current line, sometimes suggesting a whole new block of code. You can accept all, part, or ignore the suggestion. This ability to provide real-time, context-aware suggestions saves valuable development time by reducing the need to search for syntax, troubleshoot logic, or repeatedly write common patterns.

## Multiple suggestions pane
When you're working on a code block and GitHub Copilot offers a suggestion, you see a grayed-out code snippet. To explore more options, hover over the suggestion to reveal the GitHub Copilot control panel.

Click the forward or backward arrow buttons in the control panel to see the next or previous suggestions. You can also use keyboard shortcuts:

- macOS: Option (⌥) or Alt+] (next), Option (⌥) or Alt+[ (previous)
- Windows or Linux: Alt+] (next), Alt+[ (previous)

While GitHub Copilot is superb at suggesting code for you, it also demonstrates its ability to adapt through the following ways:

- Method Implementation: When you start typing a method name, Copilot can suggest the entire implementation, following your established coding style.
- Naming Conventions: It picks up on your preferred naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.
- Formatting: Copilot adapts to your indentation style, bracket placement, and other formatting preferences.
- Comment Style: It can mimic your comment style, whether you prefer inline comments, block comments, or doc strings.
- Design Patterns: When your project consistently uses certain design patterns, Copilot suggests code that aligns with these patterns.

## Understanding comment context
When integrated into your existing codebase, GitHub Copilot uses various aspects of your code to provide more relevant suggestions, including code comments. Developers often use comments to clarify code intent and enhance collaboration, and Copilot, as your AI coding assistant, makes use of these comments in much the same way. By understanding the intent behind the comments, Copilot can provide more accurate and context-aware code suggestions through two key processes:

- Natural Language Processing: Copilot uses advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to interpret the meaning and intent behind comments in the code.
- Contextual Analysis: It analyzes comments in relation to the surrounding code, understanding their relevance and purpose within the broader context of the file or project.
